Data cleaning- 
You guys did a great job cleaning missing values, dealing with outliers. Good work here. 
18/20

Feature engineering-
Good job the months to numerical valuesas well as adding a year column. These were essential for your analysis.
I think you could've added one hot encoding for the marital and education columns. As well as added bins for the age distribution. But overall good job with this. 
17/20

Data Analysis -
Amazing data analysis. Clear plots that show great understanding of what we would like to see out of this dataset. I do think you could've added a few more plots.

Concluded Insights-
Terrific job with writing your insights clearly as well as showing how you derived them from the plots. Excellent findings. 
19/20

Use of Machine Learning -
Perfect use of base algorithms vs algorithms with hyperparameter tuning. You understood the the need to stratify the data before training your model which led to great results. Great use of cross validation to find the best hyperparameters. As well as good demonstration of using neural networks. Would've like to have seen a little more playing with the hyperparameters like adding more layers and neurons as well as using Gridsearch to find the best hyperparameters.

AMAZING JOB!
